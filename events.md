### Upcoming events

* __21-22 January 2020, Veldhoven__: The complete nanoEPics team will be present again at the Physics@Veldhonven conference. The focus session "Iontronics: from nanoscale transport to industrial processes" is organized jointly by Rene van Roij (Institute for Theoretical Physics at UU) and Sanli. The invited speakers to this focus session are Lyderic Bocquet (ENS Paris), Esther Alarcon Llado (AMOLF), Michel Orrit (Leiden), and Serge Lemay (Twente).

* __26 June 2020, The Hague__:  Netherlands conference on Electrochemical Conversion & Materials (ECCM): 
Electrochemical conversion is a promising option for long-term storage as this technology is easy scalable to the amount of energy. During the conference the state-of-the-art in science and technology will be shared by international key notes from academia and industry. Dutch scientist and industry representatives will contribute to an appealing parallel programme related to the theme of the conference. During the conference national R&D initiatives related to the ECCM theme will be announced. see [call for abstracts](https://www.co2neutraalin2050.nl/netherlands-conference-on-electrochemical-conversion-26-june-2020/).

### Past events

* __27-29 November 2019, 1st ECCM Graduate school__:
The main theme of [this school](https://www.co2neutraalin2050.nl/graduateschool2019/) is Electrochemical hydrogen production and CO2 reduction. Bohdan and Zhu are among the selected participants.

* __11 October 2019, Utrecht__:
Esther Alarcon Llado, Rene van Roij, and Sanli organized the [Ionics&IontronicsNL symposium](https://www.uu.nl/en/research/nanophotonics/news-events/iontronicsnl) in Utrecht. 60 scientists from across the Netherlands participated in this event and presented their recent findings. NanoEPics research projects wer presented in four posters by main authors Bohdan, Kevin, Peter, and Zhu. [Prof. Susan Perkin](http://research.chem.ox.ac.uk/susan-perkin.aspx) (Oxford University) presented the keynote lecture.

* __24-26 June 2019, Munich__: Bohdan Yeroshenko presented at the OptoFluidics topical conference of the European Optical Society during The World of Photonic Congress in Munich, Germany. He presented one of the nanoEPics experiments that allows a high-bandwidth measurement of the electrophoretic mobility of a single nanoparticle hold by optical tweezers.

* __22-23 January 2019, Veldhoven__: The complete nanoEPics team will be present at the Physics@Veldhonven conference with two posters and one focus session. The focus session "Nanoscale Sensing" is organized jointly by Peter Zijlstra (TUE) and Sanli. The invited speakers to this focus session are Philipp Kukura (Oxford), Sonia Garcia Blanco (Twente), Gregory Sneider (Leiden), and Martin Baaske (Leiden).

* __4 September 2018, Lausanne__: Sanli presented the seminar _“single particle tracking of electrokinetic flow in nanocapillaries”_ at the bioengineering department at EPFL
* __8-12 October 2018, Delft__: The complete nanoEPics team was present at the EOSAM conference. Peter Speets presented a talk on single particle tracking and Bohdan Yeroshenko presented his result in form of a poster.
