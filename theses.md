We regularly define projects at the bachelor and master level. Please take a look at the previously accomplished projects, below, to get a view of the level we expect from our student members.

Some examples of currently possible projects are:
* Measuring electrostatic charge with optical tweezers, Arthur Ashkin and Robert Millikan united.
* Surface charge dynamics measured by optical dark-field microscopy
* High speed recording of the droplet beating heart in an acoustic trap
* Induced-charge electro-osmotic robotic arm for moving nanoparticles


If you are interested in choosing a project with us, please contact Sanli (S.Faez {at} UU {dot} NL).
