### Nanocapillary Electrophoretic Tracking
In 2015, we invented a new tracking method based on elastic light scattering by using a nanofluidic step-index silica fibers. This method can potentially enable us to track the electrophoretic mobility of single nanoparticles at kilohertz rates or higher. From the mobility, we infer the charge of the probed objects and its interaction with the surrounding environment, which allows for monitoring the kinetics of chemical reactions on the fly. A more detailed description of this approach and some important background literature are summarized in this [self journal](sjscience link).

In this new fiber, a sub-micrometer bore is enclosed concentric to the micrometer size high index core of the fiber, which guides light in a tight single optical mode irrespective of the filling inside the bore. The particles are inserted into the hole inside an aqueous solution and scatter the guided light out of the mode while diffusing freely. By index matching the cladding on a flat glass slide, it is possible to obtain an almost isotropic point image on a camera. This efficient spatial filtering allows for detection of very small particles based on their scattering, similar to bright visualization of dust particles that pass a freely propagating laser beam. Furthermore, the small diameter of the bore assures that particles do not diffuse out of the focal plan . These advantages have enabled us to track dielectric particles smaller than 20 nm and their electrophoretic mobility at a frame rate of several kilohertz

In 2016, we were granted a FOM-projectruimte to realize a proposal based on this technique: Capturing reaction kinetics on a diffusing nanoparticle.

### Single-molecule spectroscopic tracing of conduction electrons
In 2014, we [proposed](http://journals.aps.org/prb/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevB.90.205405) using organic single molecules for optical detection and positioning of individual electrons. At cryogenic conditions the optical transition linewidth of these molecules in solid host matrices is narrower than 30 MHz. Using the fact that movement of a single electron in the micrometer surrounding of such a molecule would change its transition frequency by several times its linewidth. As a result, the electron can be optically traced by following the molecular lineshift. Meanwhile, together with the group of Anders SÃ¸rensen at the Niels Bohr Institute, we devised a single photon scheme, based on this interaction, for coupling optical photons to superconducting charge qubits. The theoretical description of this scheme appeared in a [Physical Review Letters](https://journals.aps.org/prl/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevLett.118.140501) in 2017.

In 2015, NWO \(formerly FOM\) granted support for the experimental realization of this proposal. This research is currently being pursued in Leiden in the [Single-molecule Optics](http://www.single-molecule.nl) group of Michel Orrit.

### Highlights of previous projects

__Resonant coupling of light to single molecules in nanoguides__

A few decades ago, studying single quantum emitters such as atoms, ions, or molecules was a dream, but today such investigations have become commonplace in many laboratories. Building on the fantastic ingredients of the single-emitter physics toolbox, many scientists now wish to realize mesoscopic ensembles made of carefully-arranged individual quantum entities that are interconnected by quantum messengers such as visible photons. Such a network is sometimes called a quantum web. However, the direct photonic coupling of two emitters placed at distances larger than a wavelength is usually negligible. To enhance this interaction, one might use high-finesse cavities and although the first steps have been taken, it remains a very challenging experiment with severe limitations on its prospects for scalability to many atoms. An alternative approach for efficient light-matter interaction has been shown to involve tight focusing of propagating photons, but this strategy is also difficult to scale to a large number of emitters.

At the Max-Planck Institute for the Science of Light in Erlangen, we built an efficient solid-state platform for coherent interaction between photons and single molecules. Our system consists of organic dye molecules embedded inside an organic crystal that fills a glass nanocapillary to form an optical waveguide with a sub-wavelength mode diameter. With a careful choice of materials and fabrication process, each dye molecule acts like a quantum two-level system with a very high degree of coherence. We have measured the transmission of photons through this nanoguide and have seen that each time the frequency of the laser beam matches the narrow optical transitions of the individual molecules, there is an extinction signal of a few percent. Because the interaction between each molecule and light takes place via elastic scattering, the quantum coherence is preserved.
