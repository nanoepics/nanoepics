The first [Ionics&IontronicsNL workshop](https://www.uu.nl/en/research/nanophotonics/news-events/iontronicsnl) was a huge success. More than 50 researchers from accross the Netherlands, and further, participated in this scientific meeting  1- to present the most recent experimental, theoretical, and numerical methods applied to this field (e.g. atomic force microscopy, single-molecule spectroscopy, nanofluidics, dynamic density functional theory) and review some of the existing challenges, both in fundamental research (e.g. understanding nanoscale ion transport) as well as industrial applications (e.g. membrane technology, energy storage). 2- to identify and create synergetic interactions between the microscopic and process-level approaches to these most pressing problems. The invited speakers were [Susan Perkin](http://research.chem.ox.ac.uk/susan-perkin.aspx) (Oxford), [Rob Lammertink](https://people.utwente.nl/r.g.h.lammertink) (Twente), [Maarten Biesheuvel](https://www.wetsus.nl/maartenbiesheuvel) (Wetsus), [Ben Erne](https://www.uu.nl/staff/BHErne) (Utrecht), [Peter Ngene](https://www.uu.nl/staff/PNgene/) (Utrecht), [Serge Lemay](https://www.utwente.nl/en/tnw/be/) (Twente), and [Frieder Mugele](https://www.utwente.nl/en/tnw/pcf/people-oud/scientific_staff/mugele/) (Twente). 

Esther Alarcón Lladó (Amolf), René van Roij (Utrecht), and Sanli Faez (Utrecht, nanoEPics) were the organizers of this event, supported by NWO and the Debye Institute for Nanomaterials Research.

The book of abstracts, including all invited and contributing talks, is [here in PDF form](http://nanoepics.github.io/docs/IontroncisNL19_abstracts.pdf).
