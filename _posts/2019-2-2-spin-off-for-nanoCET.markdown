Together with [Aquiles Carattino](https://www.aquicarattino.com/) and [Nascent Ventures](http://nascentventures.nl/), we recieved a [take-off grant](https://www.nwo.nl/onderzoek-en-resultaten/programmas/take-off/toekenningen/2018/2018-17466) for characterization of nanoparticles in solution

An NWO Take-off grant has been awarded for commercialization of the [nanoCET platform](https://nanoepics.github.io/research/), a device that can measure the size, concentration and charge of nanoparticles while in solution. With a commercial version of this device, we hope to accommodate a very large group of researchers in different fields.

Here is an extract form the [UU news item about this grant](https://www.uu.nl/en/news/take-off-grant-for-characterization-of-nanoparticles-in-solution):

â€œThe novelty about nanoCET is the fact that samples are investigated in a solution, which keeps particles in their natural three-dimensional shape. The device can thus optically track nanoparticles like single viral proteins. It consists of an optical fiber with a channel smaller than a wavelength of light. Inside this channel, light runs through an aqueous sample that contains nanoparticles. The light is scattered, and nanoparticles are detected by the microscope.

With the NWO Take-off grant of 40,000 euros, the Light in Complex Systems group of the Debye Institute for Nanomaterials Science will be able to do a feasibility study in the first half of 2019, investigating the expected success of spin-off company. The invention itself was done in 2015, when Sanli Faez worked at Leiden University. Watch the [video](http://bit.ly/nanoCET) made by Harvard University at that time."
