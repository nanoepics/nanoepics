It is about a year since I have moved [my personal homepage](https://sanlifaez.github.io) to [githubpages]. Since then, my hosting services changed owner and they screwed our group's wordpress website when changing servers. That was for me the best excuse to stop paying for their lousy services and migrate the group website to github as well. Especially when I was reminded again of the pleasure of administrating a good-looking website with version control and simple markdown syntax. Perhaps the best feature is that you can do it offline, like for example when you are sitting on hard-stone in front of the British Library, waiting for your departure time on a Eurostar, because they don't let your fat pink luggage into the library. At least, I don't have to stay in the line.

Out of comfort, I am using the same beautiful [Uno][uno] theme, made by Josh Gerdes, and here we are, testing the new website with the first post. Check out the [Jekyll docs][jekyll] for more info on how to get the most out of Jekyll. It turns to be very easy to set up a beautiful multi-page website, once you get hold of a few basic rules. Shout out to all the open-source community and their wonderful collective achievements.

I admit that the old wordpress site was too quiet and not so informative. That was partly because posting on it needed to be online and there, there is just too much distractions. Hopefully, here we will post updates much more frequently.

Okay folks, let's communicate some nanoEPics.
