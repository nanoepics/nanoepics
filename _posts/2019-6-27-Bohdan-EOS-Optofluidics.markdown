Nano-EPics PhD-candidate Bohdan Yeroshenko gave a presentation during the European Optical Society conference on Optofluidics during The World of Photonic Congress in Munich, Germany. He presented one of the Nanophotonics Group experiments that allows a high-bandwidth measurement of electrophoretic mobility of a single nanoparticle in the optical tweezers.
