For the past two month, Sanli visited [Philipp Kukura's group](http://kukura.chem.ox.ac.uk/home) at the department of Chemistry in Oxford. This was an opportunity created by the superb hospitality of Philipp and his group members. For Sanli, spending most of his time in the lab and getting my hands busy with some of the most sensitive optical microscopes in the world was a remarkable experience. We are no strangers to sensitive microscopes, but the [iSCAMS technology](https://www.aragobio.com/), with its unique combination of sensitivity and ease of operation, is a real breakthrough.

Our collaboration with Kukura's groups will continue for the coming months and years, as we work on reporting the findings and measurements in Oxford and the new areas openned for both groups based on the joint invention disclosed by the two PIs.
